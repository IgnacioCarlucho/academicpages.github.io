I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [iCore Lab](https://icorelab.github.io/index.html) in the Mechanical Enginerinng department at [Louisiana State University](https://lsu.edu/). I am currently working on intelligent control techniques, with a focus on Reinforcement learning for the control of autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator systems. I obtained my PhD in the [National University of Central Buenos Aires](https://www.unicen.edu.ar/english) working with a scolarship from the [National Scientific and Research Council](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en).


My main research interest is focused on the development of artificial intelligence techniques for the control of complex robotic platforms, such as underwater autonomous vehicle-manipulator systems. Particularly, I am interested in reinforcement learning (RL) as a suitable control strategy for this type of complex control systems. Currently during my postdoctoral studies, I have been exploring the benefits of data-driven models and bio spired neural network architectures for control.
